# Do Language Models Exhibit Human-like Structural Priming Effects?
Code for the ACL Findings paper "Do Language Models Exhibit Human-like Structural Priming Effects?"

The code for the plots and experiments can be found in `src/main.ipynb`. The code for computing the priming effects can be found in `src/pe_scores.ipynb` (will be added soon).

The dataframe containing all our model scores can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vvvq8ASQgPRkpYb3Cykn2f7n1PWBbLOz/view?usp=sharing

Please reach out to me (Jaap) if you have any questions about the code or methodology!
